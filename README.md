# Feature for gymmembers dating online

## Context
Love can't Weight is an online dating application built with JavaScript on a node.js localhost. The sole purpose of the project is to learn to make an JavaScript enhanced feature build on top of the regular behaviour of web applications (written in HTML and CSS).

## The dating App
The idea of the app is an online dating application made for gymmembers. Gymmembers can customize their profile to their liking by uploading a picture of themselves. They can add what kind of fitness enthusiast they are (lifting, crossfit, powerlifting, cardioviscular etc). The members will be matched based on their Body Mass Index (BMI). It is the keyvalue in the matching proces. However next to the match the system will look at preferences settings such as on which date a member is avaiable to train at a gym in a given area.

## The feature
The feature is based on the job stories described in the WIKI of this repo. The feature that I want to create is a feature in where gymmember add their length and weight. The server calculates the BMI of a member and adds it to the profile.
The member can choose between two BMI values in which the system will try to match the member with other members that are withing the given margins.

## How does it work
All the files are included in the subfolder within this repo. The subfolder is called 'testserver'. Clone the folder to a directory on your local machine. Make sure Node.JS is installed and NPM as well. Open up the terminal and run 'npm install' followed by 'node server.js' after the npm command is finished installing all the required packages declared in the .JSON file.

The application can now we approached on the given localhost port in any browser. I advice to use Google Chrome for the best experience.

## More Information
All the research and information can be found in the WIKI of this repo.
