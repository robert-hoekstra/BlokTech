}

let nextDate = calcDay(options); // nextDate = 1483351200000 //GMT: Monday, January 2, 2017 10:00:00 AM
```

    daysofweek: '2;4;7'// next date will be calculated at one of the enable days "1-Monday, 2-Tuesday,...,7-Sunday"
}

let nextDate = calcDay(options1); // nextDate = 1483524000000 //GMT: Wednesday, January 4, 2017 10:00:00 AM
